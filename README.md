# PythonMathRNG
 A simple python RNG

## Installation
You need to install `uptime` and `psutil` for the program to work correctly. If you want to use the `randomImage` function you need to also install `Pillow`

## Usage
The `RNG.py` file needs to be placed in your working directory and then you can add `import RNG` at the top of your script to make the RNG functions available for use.

## Security
I have tested the code by generating 2000000 random numbers. After I had the list I used the `Duplicates` function to find two of the same numbers. None of the numbers were the same so I can assume that the range of random numbers is huge before it repeats. You can look at the `RandomImage.png` file under the tests folder to see the noise generated by the `randomImage` function. I will also be running several statistical tests on the algorithm.
